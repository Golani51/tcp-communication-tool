# TCP/IP Client-Server Communication Tool

## Overview
The TCP/IP Client-Server Communication Tool is a custom-built project designed to facilitate networking computations and client-server interactions. This tool allows clients to perform various network-related tasks by communicating with a centralized server. The server processes client requests, performs calculations, and returns the results, making it a valuable learning experience in network programming, Docker containerization, and protocol design.

## Features
- **Network Calculations**:  
  - Calculate network numbers, broadcast addresses, and subnet masks in Dotted Decimal Notation (DDN) using CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation.
  - Perform binary-to-decimal conversion for IP addressing tasks.  

- **IP Address Analysis**:  
  - Determine if two IP addresses belong to the same subnet.  
  - Verify whether an IP address is public or private.  

- **Task Validation**:  
  - Clients receive tasks from the server and submit results.  
  - The server evaluates the results and provides feedback.  

- **Containerized Environment**:  
  - Docker is used to simulate client-server interaction within isolated containers.  
  - Seamless deployment and testing across multiple Docker containers.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Networking Fundamentals**:  
  Learned the essentials of subnetting, CIDR, IP classes, and broadcast calculations.  

- **Socket Programming**:  
  Developed hands-on experience in Python socket programming for communication between clients and servers.  

- **Containerization**:  
  Utilized Docker to create isolated environments for deploying and testing the client-server model.  

- **Problem Solving**:  
  Addressed challenges such as IP miscalculations, binary conversion errors, and task handling through iterative debugging and testing.

## Challenges Faced
- **Subnetting Complexity**:  
  Understanding and implementing subnetting rules required deep research and testing.  

- **Protocol Design**:  
  Designing a clear and efficient protocol to handle client requests and server responses was a significant learning curve.  

- **Debugging**:  
  Testing the correctness of IP-related computations involved extensive use of external subnet calculators and debugging tools.

## How It Works
1. **Client-Server Communication**:  
   - The client initiates communication by sending identification data to the server.  
   - The server responds with available task options.  

2. **Task Selection**:  
   - Clients can choose tasks such as calculating network numbers, broadcast addresses, or verifying subnet information.  

3. **Validation and Feedback**:  
   - The server evaluates the client's submitted answers and provides feedback indicating success or failure.
